In Figure 6.4,

# void swtch(struct context **old, struct context *new);

should be changed to

# void swtch(struct context *old, struct context *new);

The current code in OSTEP Figure 6.4 is buggy.
I found that others already found the same bug many years ago (see the comments at https://stackoverflow.com/q/45929162/8581025).
