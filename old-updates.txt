This is not a typo, just a suggestion.

On p.4, there is a piece of source from xv6 kernel:

struct proc {

};

And I think the explanation around this piece can be more clarified if the following fact is included:
the indices for the array `ofile` are the file descriptors.
(Put it another way: the entries of the array `ofile` are indexed by the file descriptors.)

We can check the fact from the following source:
https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/12abb1a56164a0d71fb7a76a465c912409f2f60b/sysfile.c#L36-L50
