Locks, page 13, section 28.12 "Too Much Spinning: What Now?"

The first sentence reads as follows:

"Our simple hardware-based locks are simple (...) and they work (...), which are two excellent properties of any system or code."

I believe the use of "simple" as an adjective twice is redundant, and could be re-written by removing the first occurrence without loss of meaning.

-> "Our hardware-based locks are simple (...) and they work (...), which are two excellent properties of any system or code."
