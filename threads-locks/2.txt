Section 28.14

"The scheduler determines which thread runs next; if
the scheduler makes a bad choice, a thread runs that must either spin
waiting for the lock (our first approach), or yield the CPU immediately
(our second approach)."

I think the intended meaning was:

"The scheduler determines which thread runs next; if
the scheduler makes a bad choice, a thread **that runs** must either spin
waiting for the lock (our first approach), or yield the CPU immediately
(our second approach)."
