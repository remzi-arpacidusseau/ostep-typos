In page 10, under the "Using Red-Black Trees" section, in the first sentence of the third paragraph, there's a typo.
  (OLD) CFS does not keep all 'process' in this structure;
  (NEW) CFS does not keep all 'processes' in this structure;
  
FUN FACT: This page has a footer admitting a deliberate grammatical typo elsewhere in the page to mimic Gollum from LOTR.
