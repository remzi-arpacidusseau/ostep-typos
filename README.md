# ostep-typos

To file a textbook bug report, just create a file (the number should be obvious) in the directory named the same as the chapter's pdf, e.g., if the chapter is called "vm-intro", add a file with the book typo or suggestion in a numbered file in there, like 3.txt. Just pick a number that is the next highest one for that chapter. Thank you for your help!

**NOTICE:** We are a bit behind on fixing typos, large and small. We plan to address most/all of them this Fall (Fall '23), for the next revision of the book. Thank you!
