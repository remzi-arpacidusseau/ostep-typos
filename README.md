# ostep-typos

IMPORTANT: Before filing any typo or stylistic bug, please just ask ChatGPT or some similar tool what it thinks both about the original sentence and also about the proposed fix you have. Thanks!

REPORTING: To file a textbook bug report, *just create an issue*. Thank you for your help!

Those issues deemed as valid typos will lead to a credit to you in the book preface. If your name isn't obviously linked to your github account, please add it to the issue, if you wish your name to be included in the book.

(the old way of filing a typo was proving too cumbersome; old updates in those files are kept [here](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-typos/blob/master/old-updates.txt)).
