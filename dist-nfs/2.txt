If we compare "Figure 49.4: The NFS Protocol: Examples"
with RFC 1094 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1094.html) which is
a specification for NFSv2, we can find Figure 49.4 has some errors.

I was not sure I was doing right but I also deleted "count" in the arguments
for NFSPROC_WRITE because RFC 1094 says:
'The arguments "beginoffset" and "totalcount" are ignored and are removed
in the next protocol revision.'
Maybe "count" information is included in "nfsdata" in RFC 1094? I don't know..
